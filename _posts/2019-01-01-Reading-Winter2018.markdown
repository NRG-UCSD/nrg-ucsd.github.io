Hi! Welcome to Networks Reading Group for Winter 2018.

This group is for people interested in the areas of communication networks and neural networks! We plan to meet every week and discuss on a relevant topic. The goal is to understand and learn about the current research in the areas of communication networks, AI, and ML.  

### Who will present?
Everyone in the group is encouraged to lead the discussion. You can present a conference paper, research ideas, literature review, book chapter, IEEE standard, or anything you like. You can also borrow some slides from a talk given at conference. 
**The presenters list can be found [here on GoogleDoc][GDrive]**.

### Why Participate?

* It’s casual. No pressure!
* Meet and discuss with your colleagues

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve --watch`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated. --->

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
