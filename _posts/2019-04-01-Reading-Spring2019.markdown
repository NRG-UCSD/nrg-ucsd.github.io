Hi! Welcome to Networks Reading Group for Winter 2019.

Networks Reading Group [NRG] is a group of students interested in the areas of **communication networks** and **neural networks!** We meet every week (Fridays) and discuss a relevant topic. The goal is to understand and learn about the current research in the areas of communication networks, AI, and ML. Someone within the group would lead the discussion every Friday.

### Who will present?
Everyone in the group is encouraged to lead the discussion. You can present a conference paper, research ideas, literature review, book chapter, IEEE standard, or anything you like. You can also borrow some slides from a talk given at conference. 
The list of presenters can be found [here][GDrive].

### Why Participate?

* It’s casual. No pressure!
* Meet and discuss with your colleagues
* Learn about interesting and exciting science with like-minded people
* Build your academic skills (presenting, analysis/criticism)
* Get faster at reading papers
