Hi! Welcome to Networks Reading Group for Fall 2018.

This group is for people interested in the areas of communication networks and neural networks! We plan to meet every week and discuss on a relevant topic. The goal is to understand and learn about the current research in the areas of communication networks, AI, and ML. Two people within the group would lead the discussion for 30 min each. 

### Who will present?
Everyone in the group is encouraged to lead the discussion atleast once a quarter. You can present a conference paper, research ideas, literature review, book chapter, IEEE standard, or anything you like. You can also borrow some slides from a talk given at conference. 
**Please put your name to get a time slot for your presentation [here on GoogleDoc][GDrive]**.

### Why Participate?

* It’s casual. No pressure!
* Meet and discuss with your colleagues
* Learn about interesting and exciting science with like-minded people
* Build your academic skills (presenting, analysis / criticism,)
* Get faster at reading papers
