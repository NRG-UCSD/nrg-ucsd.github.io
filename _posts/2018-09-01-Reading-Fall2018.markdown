Hi! Welcome to Networks Reading Group [Fall 2018](https://nrg-ucsd.github.io/2018/09/01/Reading-Fall2018.html)

This group is for people interested in the area of communication networks and neural networks! We plan to meet every week and discuss on a relevant topic. 

### Why Participate?
* It’s casual. No pressure!
* Meet and discuss with your colleagues
* Learn about interesting and exciting science with like-minded people
* Build your academic skills (reading, analysis / criticism, writing, presenting)
* Get faster at reading papers

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve --watch`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated. --->

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
