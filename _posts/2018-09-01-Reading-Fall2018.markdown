Hi! Welcome to Networks Reading Group for Fall 2018.

This group is for people interested in the areas of communication networks and neural networks! We plan to meet every week and discuss on a relevant topic. The goal is to understand and learn about the current research in the areas of communication networks, AI, and ML. Two people within the group would lead the discussion for 30 min each. 

### Who will present?
Everyone in the group is encouraged to lead the discussion atleast once a quarter. You can present a conference paper, research ideas, literature review, book chapter, IEEE standard, or anything you like. You can also borrow some slides form a talk given at conference.

### Why Participate?

* It’s casual. No pressure!
* Meet and discuss with your colleagues
* Learn about interesting and exciting science with like-minded people
* Build your academic skills (presenting, analysis / criticism,)
* Get faster at reading papers

### How to participate

Anyone can attend the meetings. You are also encouraged to lead the discussion and prepare a presentation for 30 min slot. Please put your name to get a time slot for your presentation [here on GoogleDoc][GDrive].

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve --watch`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated. --->

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
