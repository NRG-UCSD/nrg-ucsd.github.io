This group is for people interested in the area of communication networks and neural networks! We plan to meet every week and discuss on a relevant topic. The goal is to understand and learn about the current research in the areas of communication networks, AI, and ML. Two people within our group would lead the discussion for 30 min each. You can present any recent paper, research ideas, literature review, book chapter, IEEE standard, or anything you like. You can also borrow some slides form a talk given at conference.
