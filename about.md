This group is for people interested in the areas of **communication networks** and **neural networks!** We plan to meet every week and discuss on a relevant topic. The goal is to understand and learn about the current research in the areas of communication networks, AI, and ML. The topic of presentation can be a conference paper, research idea, literature review, book chapter, IEEE standard, or any related material.
