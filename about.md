NRG is a group of students interested in the areas of **communication networks** and **neural networks!** We meet every week (Fridays 1 PM) and discuss a relevant topic. The goal is to understand and learn about the current research in the areas of communication networks, AI, and ML. Someone within the group would lead the discussion every Friday.

Please go to [Reading - Spring 2019](https://nrgucsd.github.io/2019/04/01/Reading-Spring2019.html) for more details.
